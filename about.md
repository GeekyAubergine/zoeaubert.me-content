Hi there, I’m a software developer from Jersey, living and working in Portsmouth. I dabble in various projects from simulation and optimisation problems, to game development and visualisations.

I work at [Radweb](https://radweb.co.uk) on [InventoryBase](https://inventorybase.co.uk) and other projects, primarily focusing on app development and [Conditional Logic](https://support.inventorybase.com/en/articles/5813900-conditional-logic).

When I'm not at my computer I collect and paint [Warhammer](/tags/warhammer), play [Music](/tags/musician) and take [Photos](/albums).

To see more of who I am and what I'm up to, check out my [/now](/now) page. You can find me as `geekyaubergine` on most platforms.
